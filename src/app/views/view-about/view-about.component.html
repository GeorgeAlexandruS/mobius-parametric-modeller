        <h3>What is Möbius  Modeller?</h3>
        <p>Möbius Modeller is an open-source web application for 3D parametric modelling. 
            The app allows users to create modelling procedures using the Obi visual programming language.
            In the Obi language, your write computer programs by drawing flowcharts and by defining procedures
            using 'click and fill-in-the-blanks' coding. </p>
        <p>Since Mobius Modeller is a web app, you can just go ahead an use it. Just click the icons.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>It is online, so there is need to install software.</li>
            <li>It is free, so there is no need to creat an account or to log in.</li>
            <li>It runs in the browser so there is no need to worry about network speed.</li>
            <li>Your data never leaves your browser, so there is no need to data privacy and security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The resulting models can be 
            published as interactive web pages, allowing visitors on the web to explore the models.</p>


        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>The best way to start using Möbius Modeller is to explore some of the models in the gallery.
            After that you can dive in and start creating your own flowcharts and procedures. </p>
        <p>The icons at the top of the page allow you to navigate into your model, from teh top level 
            dashboard down the procedures at the bottom level.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gallery</b>: The gallery contains a selection of example models for you to explore. 
                To access the gallery, 
                click <mat-icon (click)='routeTo("/gallery")'>view_comfy</mat-icon></li>.
            <li><b>Dashboard</b>: Each model has its own dashbaord that exposes a set of parameters, that can be set using sliders and UI components.
                To access the dashboard, 
                click <mat-icon svgIcon="cDashboard" (click)='routeTo("/dashboard")'></mat-icon></li>.
            <li><b>Flowchart</b>: Each model is has a flowchart that defines a set of nodes connected with edges. 
                To access the flowchart, 
                click <mat-icon svgIcon="cFlowchart" (click)='routeTo("/flowchart")'></mat-icon></li>.
            <li><b>Procedure</b>: Each node in the model has its own procedure, defined using the 'Obi' visual programming language.
                To access the procedure, 
                click <mat-icon svgIcon="cEditor" (click)='routeTo("/editor")'></mat-icon>.
        </ul>
