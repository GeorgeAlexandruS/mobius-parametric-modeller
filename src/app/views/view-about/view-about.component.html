        <h3>What is Möbius  Modeller?</h3>
        <p>Möbius Modeller is an open-source web application for 3D parametric modelling. 
            The app allows users to create modelling procedures using the Öbi visual programming language.
            In the Öbi language, your write computer programs by drawing flowcharts and by defining procedures
            using 'click and fill-in-the-blanks' coding. </p>
        <p>Since Mobius Modeller is a web app, you can just go ahead an use it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The software is free, so there is need to pay!</li>
            <li>The software is online, so there is need to install anything on your computer.</li>
            <li>The software does not require authentication, so there is no need to create an account or to log in.</li>
            <li>Code is executed in your browser, so there is no need to worry about network speed.</li>
            <li>Your data never leaves your browser, so there is no need to worry about data privacy and security.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The Möbius models that you create can be 
            published as interactive web pages, allowing visitors on the web to explore the models.</p>


        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
        <p>The best way to start using Möbius Modeller is to explore some of the models in the gallery.
            After that you can dive in and start creating your own flowcharts and procedures. </p>
        <p>The icons at the top of the page allow you to navigate into your model, from the top level 
            dashboard down the procedures at the bottom level.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Gallery</b>: The gallery contains a selection of example models for you to explore. 
                To access the gallery, 
                click <mat-icon>view_comfy</mat-icon></li>.
            <li><b>Dashboard</b>: Each model has its own dashbaord that exposes a set of parameters, that can be set using sliders and UI components.
                To access the dashboard, 
                click <mat-icon svgIcon="cDashboard"></mat-icon></li>.
            <li><b>Flowchart</b>: Each model is has an Öbi flowchart that defines a set of nodes connected with edges. 
                To access the flowchart, 
                click <mat-icon svgIcon="cFlowchart"></mat-icon></li>.
            <li><b>Procedure</b>: Each node in the model has its own procedure, defined using the Öbi language.
                To access the procedure, 
                click <mat-icon svgIcon="cEditor"></mat-icon>.
        </ul>
